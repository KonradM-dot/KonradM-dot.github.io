<h1>More About Us</h1>
 <p>Hi there! I'm the founder of Mateu, project manager, innovation lead, and, since recently, aspiring software developer.</p>

      <p>I am accomplished and results-oriented Project Manager with over 10 years of experience in change management, including 7 years of leading the full project life cycle delivery of Business Change and Transformation projects/programmes. I possess relevant professional qualifications, including MSP, Agile, Prince2, and APMP.</p><br>
      <p>Furthermore, I am adaptable Problem Solver who performed continuous stakeholder management. I have set up and led projects’ governance including committees’ facilitation for stakeholders at various levels. I have produced plans and communicated regular status reporting on progress. I have inspired and motivated remote teams and worked closely with senior business stakeholders to ensure delivery to time, budget, quality, and in line with expectations.<p><br>
      <p>And most of all, I am Confident Facilitator. I have created comprehensive presentations and run face to face and virtual sessions for senior leadership and their reports to enable turning complexities into deliverable solutions, facilitate processes change, and ensure compliance.</p><br>

        <p><strong>Expanding consultancy services by software development</strong></p><br>
        <p>If somebody would have told me a month ago that I would be able to make a <strong>website</strong> from scratch, I would not have believed them.</p><br>
        <p>Not long ago, during the COVID19 lockdown in June 2020, I came across the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn"> freeCodeCamp</a> website and started to work on a <em>real</em> code. I am getting more and more confident in the area of web development. Hence, should you be looking for a project/programme lead with software coding skills you are lucky because you have found me.</p><br>
